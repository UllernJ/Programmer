# Password generator made of Ullern.
 It is important to have a complex and long password. This is due to the ability to crack password based on length, the longer the password is,
 The more different combinations are possible.
 
## Why use my password generator?

<p>This password generator will use completely random numbers, symbols and letters. This will eliminate the personified password type that also 'weakens' passwords. </ P>

## Extra tip:

<p> - This will not be an "total" password, the opportunity is always there. But if that happens, it's most likely that your password has been leaked somehow. </p>
<p> - Be critical of using the same password on multiple pages, ask yourself how many times have you used the same password, on different pages? </p>
<p> - A nice page to get an overview of the data breach you might be affected by: https://haveibeenpwned.com/ </p>
<p> - Where should I save passwords? Password should, in my opinion, be stored physically and not on the PC anywhere for optimal security. </p>
